## Data Rangers 8086 - Work Plan & RQs


#### Data Set Description
This data is published by the Nebraska Crime Commission, an entity whose mission is to "...develop comprehensive plans and coordinate activities related to the improvement of criminal justice administration among state and local agencies.".  The data comes in 3 separate pdf documents, each corresponding to a data category:  

* Crime in Nebraska
* Traffic Stops
* Law Enforcement Staffing  

Crime in Nebraska features aggregated data about types of crimes by age of offenders, geographic population of crime area, and frequency.  Traffic Stops break down annual officer stop data by location, frequency, race, and historical statistics.  Law Enforcement Staffing looks at how police departments deploy their staff, and whether sufficient levels were maintained.

There are at least 10 years of data for each data set, our plan is to scrape each and combine them for analysis.  Data is listed in tables in PDF documents.  The time-series nature of the data provides  interesting options for external data sets to combine with.
#### Target Audience
Our target audience could include individuals from the private, public, for profit, and not-for-profit sectors, including sectors such as:

* Law Enforcement
* Insurance and Actuarial Science
* Real Estate Agencies
* Civil Rights Organization
* Individuals looking to move

As our data deals with types of crime over a geographic area, law enforcement agencies could use it to compare their efficacy in combating certain types of crime year over year.  It could also serve as a nationwide comparator when looking at law and order between states with similar population characteristics.  When combining the Law Enfocement Staffing and Crime in Nebraska statistics, it could be possible to justify hiring additional police or revising staffing levels.  

It's possible to place the crime occurring in different cities across Nebraska.  Many businesses and individuals are interested in tracking crime rates in a geographic area over time.  There is a significant difference living somewhere with high property crimes versus high violent burglary rates.  Insurance companies may adjust their rates based on crime statistics for a city, and how it impacts the life span of individuals living there.

 



  



#### Assignment Responsibilities

Our assignment responsibilities are included here to give a general overview of our expected contributions by assignment based on the information we current have.  These roles are likely to change and evolve over time as we become more accustomed working together as a team. 

**Work Plan & RQs**  
Chaitra is focused on the draft research questions, Shivani is creating the project gantt chart and schedule, and Will is going to complete a write up on 'target audience for the analysis' and 'dataset description'.

**Peer Review 1: RQs**  
Each team member will do their own individual review.

**Data Cleaning Documentation**  
For this assignment we will each research datasets in the category we are trying to fill in.  We plan to meet as a group, share our findings, and discuss how to best integrate the datasets we found. Each team member will be responsible for contributing a portion of any script or data cleaning documentation.  
  
**R Script**  
Our R Script will start as an individual process, with each team member practicing on their own data set.  We then plan to meet as a team and share our findings before deciding how to best combine our scripts into a single deliverable.  
  
**R Plots**  
This deliverable will follow a similar process to that of the R Script.  We will need to integrate a presentation format, whether HTML or markdown. In order to best decide our presentation strategy, a review of team member skills and interests will be conducted.  
  
**Audience Persona**  
The Audince Persona will be a collaborative deliverable - more information will be given in class on this assignment.  
  
**Peer Review 2: Personas**  
Each team member will do their own individual review.
  
**Presentation**  
The presentation will be planned and executed as a team, using our domain knowledge and data conclusions from the project.
  
**Git Repository Package**  
In this deliverable our end-to-end workflow for our Crime in Nebraska data set will be showcased in out team Git repository.  At this stage of the project, it is expected our skills will be well know to each other, and we will be able to delegate tasks efficiently such as programming, writeups, and persona review.
