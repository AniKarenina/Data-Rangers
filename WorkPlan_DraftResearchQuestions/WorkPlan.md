## Data Rangers 8086 - Work Plan & RQs


#### Data Set Description
This data is published by the Nebraska Crime Commission, an entity whose mission is to "...develop comprehensive plans and coordinate activities related to the improvement of criminal justice administration among state and local agencies.".  The data comes in 3 separate pdf documents, each corresponding to a data category:  

* Crime in Nebraska
* Traffic Stops
* Law Enforcement Staffing  

Crime in Nebraska features aggregated data about types of crimes by age of offenders, geographic population of crime area, and frequency.  Traffic Stops break down annual officer traffic stop data by location, frequency, race, and historical statistics.  Law Enforcement Staffing looks at how police departments deploy their staff, and whether sufficient staffing levels were maintained.

There are at least 10 years of data for each data set, our plan is to scrape each and combine them for analysis.  Data is listed in tables in PDF documents.  The time-series nature of the data provides interesting opportunities to combine with external data sets.
#### Target Audience
Our target audience could include individuals from the private, public, for profit, and not-for-profit sectors, including sectors such as:

* Law Enforcement
* Insurance and Actuarial Science
* Real Estate Agencies
* Civil Rights Organization
* Individuals looking to move

As our data deals with types of crime over a geographic area, law enforcement agencies could use it to compare their efficacy in combating certain types of crime year over year.  It could also serve as a nationwide comparator when looking at law and order between states with similar population characteristics.  When combining the Law Enforcement Staffing and Crime in Nebraska statistics, it could be possible to justify hiring additional police or revising staffing levels.  

It's possible to place the crime occurring in different cities across Nebraska.  Many businesses and individuals are interested in tracking crime rates in a geographic area over time.  There is a significant difference living somewhere with high property crimes versus high violent burglary rates.  Insurance companies may adjust their rates based on crime statistics for a city, and how it impacts the life span of individuals living there. Civil Rights organizations may be interested in the types of crimes committed and how police departments hire and treat different groups of individuals.  The type(s) of external data sets we choose to combine with will further influence potential target audiences.

### Projected Timeline of Project

* We have estimated the time for each deliverable which is represented using the Gantt Chart, which you can find [here](https://github.com/Shivani-Parihar/Data-Rangers/blob/master/WorkPlan_DraftResearchQuestions/ProjectWorkPlan.pdf).

* Projected timeline for the project is 09/16/2017 - 12/6/2017 which come * ~ 82 days *.
> Note : We have taken both weekends and weekdays in account, as being students most of the time we find is over weekends

* Our team will take continuous feedbacks within the team members and Professor. We will also do a retrospective after each deliverable to continue doing the good things and to overcome issues and impediments.
