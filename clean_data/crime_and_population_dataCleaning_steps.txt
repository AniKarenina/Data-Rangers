Manual cleaning steps are detailed in “Cleaning Steps”

All other cleaning procedures were completed in: 

python 3.6.1 
pandas 0.20.1
numpy 1.12.1 
R Studio


Scripts are written in R with Python. Scripts have to be in the same folder where the raw data files are in order to be executed successfully

***All functions referenced for data cleaning can be found in "crime_and_population_cleaning.py" and the dataframe merging steps can be found in "Combining_crime_and_population.R"***

Data Cleaning Steps in Python
*********************************

1. Data was scraped from the “Law Enforcement Employment in Nebraska Series” for the years 2016 through 2007 - (https://ncc.nebraska.gov/stat-reports#Crime_in_Nebraska_Series) and by Nebraska demographics gave population for each county - (https://www.nebraska-demographics.com/counties_by_population)

   

Data Checkpoint: County_and_agency_based_crime.csv & County_population.csv

2. The county crime had data from 2000 onwards but we are only working with data from 2007 so the data before 2007 is removed

3. The crime data had Agency data for each county and it has to be dropped as well it would have prevented us from grouping(using GROUPBY) the county crime data


4. To complete our analysis, it was necessary to include the county's population as it would help us analyze how the population affects the number of crimes in each county. And in order to acheive this the county population column from county population data was merged with crime data

5. It was discovered that few spaces in County_population.csv has some spaces which created problems while importing the file with panda. so in order to fix that I initially used sublime text and regex to replace those problematic spaces with an underscore

6. After importing(refer step 5) I replaced the _County with and empty string in order to make a column of common values between the two CSVs that is County_and_agency_based_crime.csv & County_population.csv

7. Still few underscores persisted with in the county names, they were removed with the same approach as in step 6 that is they were replaced by using replace function and replaced underscore with an empty string

Data merging Steps in R
*********************************

The data merging step between two CSV was difficult in Python as compared to R. So R was a better option to opt at this stage

1. First, set the working directory where pre-cleaned files from python scripts are located

2. Create two dataframes for two different CSVs we are dealing with that is County_and_agency_based_crime.csv & County_population.csv

3. Create a new column "Population" in the crime data CSV and populate it with the matching county population data from the County_population.csv. Here the common column between both the CSV is "County"

Final Cleaned Data: County_crime_and_population_combined.csv
