## Dataset list based on priority

1. 500 Cities Health

  * We are gravely concerned about the health and well being of future generations.  Having visited multiple cities in the United States - we are curious to compare how the well being of the people living there is impacted.  Specifically, how many weeks of life span have we gained or lost living in Omaha?

2. Nebraska Crime

 * One of our team members has had experience analyzing crime in Nebraska and was interested in augmenting her research.  We are not scared by having to extract data from the pdfs, and feel there would be a lot of additional data to include.  It would be interesting to analyze this in a time series manner.
